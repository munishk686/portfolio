          Hi, I am Munish Kumar, a Software Development graduate from AUT with a
          passion for building practical, user-friendly web applications. My
          background spans both technology and people â€” after 22 years as a bus
          driver delivering reliable service, I retrained in software
          development to turn my curiosity for technology into a career. I enjoy
          working with React, Next.js, Node.js, and AWS, and I have built projects
          ranging from IoT monitoring systems to MERN apps and multiplayer
          games. My strengths are problem-solving, collaboration, and
          continuously learning new tools to create scalable solutions. I am now
          looking to join a forward-thinking team where I can grow as a
          developer, contribute to real-world projects, and make a meaningful
          impact through technology.
