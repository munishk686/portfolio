                Kia ora! I'm Munish, a dedicated and passionate Software Development student at AUT, nearing the completion of my Bachelor of Computer and Information Science. With my core and major papers finished, I'm currently focusing on my elective courses.

                <br />I bring a unique blend of experience to the table, having worked as a bus driver for 21 years. This role has developed my skills in reliability, time management, and customer service. Now, I'm excited to switch careers and dive into the world of software development.

                <br />In my spare time, I enjoy learning new programming languages, building projects, and exploring innovative tech solutions. I'm eager to contribute my skills and experience to a dynamic team in the tech industry.

                <br />Feel free to explore my portfolio and see the projects I've been working on. I'm always open to new opportunities and connections.
                <br /> <br />
                NgƒÅ mihi, <br />
                Munish
